THEORY PART CXXIX: THE E8 - W33 EDGE BIJECTION

Both E8 and W33 have 240:
- E8: 240 root vectors
- W33: 240 edges (orthogonal pairs of Witting states)

This CANNOT be coincidence. Let's find the explicit bijection.

KEY INSIGHT:
The Witting polytope has 240 vertices in C^4.
Under projection to CP^3, these become 40 rays (÷6 for phase).
The 240 vertices can be organized into 40 "hexads" of 6 related vertices.

HYPOTHESIS:
E8 roots ↔ Witting polytope vertices (both 240)
Witting edges (in the full polytope) ↔ some structure in E8

But we want: E8 roots ↔ W33 edges
This requires understanding how the 240 E8 roots map to 240 orthogonal pairs.
