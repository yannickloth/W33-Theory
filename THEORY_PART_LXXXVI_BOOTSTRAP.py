W33 THEORY PART LXXXVI: THE BOOTSTRAP

Can W33 derive ITSELF? Can physics determine its own mathematical structure?

This explores self-consistency: the universe must be describable by
mathematics that can exist WITHIN that universe.

The ultimate question: Is W33 self-referential?

THE BOOTSTRAP IDEA:

In the 1960s, Geoffrey Chew proposed that nature might be self-consistent:
particles exist because they MUST exist, not because of external causes.

APPLIED TO W33:

If physics comes from W33, can we derive W33 from physics?

The argument would be CIRCULAR - but that's the point!
A self-consistent theory bootstraps itself into existence.

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
1. Can we derive v=40 from physical requirements?
2. Can we derive k=12 from α⁻¹=137?
3. Does the theory predict its own existence?
