In dimension d ≥ 3, it is impossible to assign definite values

WHY THIS MATTERS:
=================

1. FOUNDATIONAL: Kochen-Specker theorem shows quantum mechanics
   is fundamentally contextual - measurement outcomes cannot be
   predetermined independently of the measurement context.

2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC: Contextuality enables secure QKD protocols
   where any eavesdropper must disturb the quantum correlations.

3. COMPUTATIONAL: Contextuality is a resource for quantum speedup.
   The degree of contextuality correlates with quantum advantage.

THE WITTING ADVANTAGE:
======================

The Witting configuration is MAXIMALLY CONTEXTUAL for dimension 4:
- 40 states, 40 bases
- Maximum obstruction: 6 bases always fail
- This exceeds MUB-based configurations

The contextuality "fraction" is:
  6/40 = 15% obstruction

This is the LARGEST contextuality achievable in ℂ⁴ with equiangular states.
