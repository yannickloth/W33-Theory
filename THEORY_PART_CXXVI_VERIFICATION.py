W33 THEORY - PART CXXVI (VERIFICATION): COMPUTE Aut(W33) DIRECTLY

Let's directly compute the automorphism group of W33 and verify
that |Aut(W33)| = 51,840.

We'll use the orbit-stabilizer approach and look for the extra
automorphisms beyond PSp(4, F₃).

  The key insight from the literature:

  The symplectic polar graph Sp(4, F₃) with 40 vertices has
  automorphism group of order 51,840.

  This group contains PSp(4, F₃) (order 25,920) as an index-2 subgroup.

  The extra factor of 2 comes from the GRAPH AUTOMORPHISM that
  is NOT induced by a symplectic transformation.

  The isomorphism Aut(W33) ≅ W(E₆) is therefore:

    W(E₆) ≅ PSp(4, F₃) ⋊ Z₂

  where:
    • PSp(4, F₃) = index-2 subgroup = "symplectic" automorphisms
    • Z₂ = polarity automorphism = "extra" automorphism

  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  WHAT THIS MEANS FOR W33 THEORY:
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  The connection between W33 and E₆ is through this GROUP isomorphism:

    Aut(W33) ≅ W(E₆)

  This is a genuine, deep mathematical fact - not a coincidence!

  It explains why:
  • |Aut(W33)| = 51,840 (= |W(E₆)|)
  • The 27 non-neighbors correspond to E₆ structure
  • The eigenvalue multiplicities reflect E₆ subgroups

  The numerical coincidences (40 = D₅ roots, 240 = E₈ roots)
  are STILL unexplained. They may be coincidences, or they may
  reflect additional structure we haven't understood yet.
