W33 ↔ N12_58: Cycle parities, loop lifts, and canonical Z2 gauge (v14)

This bundle operationalizes the plan:
1) Treat the 90 center-quads (four-center triad components) as a 2-cover of the 45-point quotient Q.
2) Use the precomputed Z2 voltage/sign on Q edges (quotient_Q_edges_with_Z2_voltage.csv).
3) Fix a *canonical gauge* by selecting a BFS spanning tree from root 0 and choosing vertex flips g[v] so that
   every tree edge has canonical voltage 0. This yields deterministic canonical voltages on all Q edges:
       w_canon(u,v) = w_raw(u,v) XOR g[u] XOR g[v]
4) Identify where each 2T cycle lives in the 2-cover by mapping its W33 center_quad to quad_id and then to the
   corresponding gq42_point and sheet (quad0/quad1 under the canonical gauge).
5) Compute per-cycle:
   - commutator parity: (-1)^{#moves} using the universal commutator phase (-1) per K4 move
   - triad holonomy phase product: Π exp(2πi h/12) with h ∈ {3,9} giving factors ±i
   - total complex phase = commutator_sign * holonomy_phase
