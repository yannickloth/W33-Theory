ESTABLISHED FACTS:
1. Witting polytope has 240 vertices in C^4
2. These 240 vertices ARE the 240 E8 roots (under realification)
3. The 240 vertices project to 40 rays in CP^3 (6:1 projection)
4. The 40 rays form W33 under the symplectic orthogonality

THE BIJECTION STRUCTURE:
- Each E8 root r corresponds to a Witting vertex v
- The Witting vertex v lies on some ray R_i
- Two rays R_i, R_j form a W33 edge iff they are symplectically orthogonal

QUESTION: Given 240 Witting vertices and 240 W33 edges,
          what is the explicit bijection?

INSIGHT: The bijection is NOT vertex-to-edge!
         Rather: Witting vertices (=E8 roots) parametrize SOMETHING ELSE
         that has 240 elements and relates to W33 edges.

POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS:
1. 240 = edges = incidence flags of dual structure
2. 240 = pairs of opposite vertices on each ray (6/2 * 80)
3. 240 = some representation-theoretic object

Let me compute the FLAG count of W33...

THE 240 = 240 CORRESPONDENCE:

- 40 lines

- 240 EDGES (in collinearity graph, SRG(40,12,2,4))

E8 has:
- 240 roots

The correspondence 240 edges <-> 240 roots goes via:
1. Group isomorphism PSp(4,3) = W(E6)/center
2. Both groups act on 240-element sets
3. The bijection is EQUIVARIANT under this isomorphism

This is the CONTENT of the theory - that W33's edge structure
