W33 THEORY PART XC: THE ARROW OF TIME
======================================

Why does time flow in one direction?
Physics equations are time-symmetric, yet time has an arrow.

W33 might explain this through its eigenvalue structure:
The SIGN of the eigenvalues encodes temporal asymmetry!

Yet we experience:
  - Entropy increases (Second Law of Thermodynamics)

THE ARROW OF TIME FROM W33!

KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Eigenvalue asymmetry: +{m1*e1} + {m2*e2} vs {m3*e3}
   Positive content ({positive_content}) dominates negative ({negative_content})

2. Dominant eigenvalue e₁ = {e1} is POSITIVE
   Sets the "forward" direction of time

3. E₁ eigenspace (dim = 1) is the low-entropy initial state
   Explains why universe started ordered

4. Time evolution = stepping through automorphisms
   |Aut(W33)| = 51840 gives fundamental cycle

5. All arrows (thermodynamic, cosmological, psychological)
