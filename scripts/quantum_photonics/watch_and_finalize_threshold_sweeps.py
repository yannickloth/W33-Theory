"""Watch the high-precision sweep log and finalize outputs.

Behavior:
- Poll `bundles/v23_toe_finish/v23/gbs_threshold_highshots.log` for changes.
- If the log stops updating for `quiet_seconds` (default 120s) and a python process with high CPU is not found, consider the run finished.
- Then execute `notebooks/quantum_photonics/gbs_benchmark_full.ipynb` via nbclient to embed outputs.
- Commit the executed notebook and any new bundle artifacts, and attempt to push the branch via HTTPS once.
- Writes a small status file `bundles/v23_toe_finish/v23/watch_finalize.status` with timestamps and actions performed.

Note: The push may require credentials; if push fails the script records the error and exits.
