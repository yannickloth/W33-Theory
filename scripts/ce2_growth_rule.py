"""Deterministic growth rule for CE2 simple-family using kernel state.

This module exports a minimal finite automaton describing the evolution of
sign patterns along a growth line under the two nontrivial axis-swaps of
Sp(2,3).  The observable state is an index in {0..7} corresponding to one of
the eight sign triples.  The auxiliary "phase tag" is an index in {0..17}
representing the triple (t,w,z_sum) described in the notes.  Together the
pair (tag,pattern) constitutes the smallest lifted state in which the action
of either swap is single-valued.

The tables are built on import using the helpers in
``scripts.ce2_kernel_action``; no external data or lookup tables are
required.  This module is intended as the basis for the DNA/tile-von
Neumann growth constructions referred to in the conversation.
