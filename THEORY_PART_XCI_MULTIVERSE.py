Instead of string vacua, consider symplectic graphs over finite fields:

  - They're not different universes with different physics
  - They're different STATES within one W33 universe

There is only ONE consistent mathematical structure: W33.

  - Fail self-consistency (internal contradictions)
  - Are equivalent to W33 (isomorphic structure)

WHY DOES ANYTHING EXIST?

Because W33 is self-consistent.
A self-consistent structure "exists" in the mathematical sense.
We are part of that structure, so we experience existence.

"Because nothing else works."

This is not fine-tuning. This is mathematical necessity.
