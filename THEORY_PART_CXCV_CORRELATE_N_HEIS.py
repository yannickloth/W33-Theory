"""Pillar 94 (Part CXCV): Correlate regular subgroup N with block and t4-grade structure

The regular subgroup N of Gamma (order 192, acting sharply transitively on the
192 tomotope flags) is constructed in Pillar 93.  This pillar analyses the
relationship between N and the Heisenberg-coordinate structure established in
Pillars 83-89, identifying the key structural constraints that prevent N from
being a Heisenberg group itself.

Theorems:

T1  N has order distribution {1:1, 2:43, 3:32, 4:84, 6:32} and trivial centre
    Z(N) = {e}.  Consequently N is NOT a Heisenberg group (Heisenberg groups
    have non-trivial centres).

T2  N acts on the 48 <r0,r3>-blocks of the tomotope by sending block(0) to
    block(n(0)).  This action is transitive (N surjects onto all 48 blocks)
    and each block is the image of exactly |N|/48 = 4 elements.  The point
    stabiliser Stab_N(block_0) is a subgroup of order 4 with orders {1,2,2,4}.

T3  The element t^4 = (r1*r2)^4 has order 3 and partitions the 192 flags into
    grade classes: grade-0 = fixed flags (and cycle leaders), grade-1,2 = the
    remaining two positions in each 3-cycle.  The distribution of t4-grades
    among the 192 images {n(0) : n in N} is {0:128, 1:32, 2:32}.

T4  All 32 order-3 elements of N map flag 0 to a grade-0 flag.  Together with
    the identity they generate a subgroup of order 48 with distribution
    {1:1, 2:15, 3:32}.  The 27 Heisenberg qids from the K-model relate to this
    structure: note 27 does not divide 192 (since 192 = 2^6 * 3), confirming
    no surjection N -> Z3^3 exists.

T5  Elements of t4-grade 1 or 2 (total 64) have orders exclusively in {2,4,6};
    no order-3 element of N maps flag 0 to a grade-1 or grade-2 flag.

T6  Elements of t4-grade 0 have ALL five order types {1,2,3,4,6}, while those
    of grade 1 or 2 have only orders {2,4,6} (no order-1 or order-3 elements).
    In particular the 32 order-6 elements split: 10 have grade 0 and 22 have
    grade 1 or 2, whereas the 32 order-3 elements ALL have grade 0.
