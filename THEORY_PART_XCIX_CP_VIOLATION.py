SAKHAROV CONDITIONS (1967):

For baryogenesis, we need:
  1. Baryon number violation (B)
  2. C and CP violation
  3. Departure from thermal equilibrium

The Standard Model has ALL THREE... but not enough CP violation!
BSM physics (like W33) must provide additional CP violation.

WHERE DOES CP VIOLATION COME FROM IN W33?

The W33 graph is REAL - the adjacency matrix A has real entries.
But COMPLEX structure emerges from:

1. The symplectic form ω over F₃
   ω(u,v) = u₁v₂ - u₂v₁ + u₃v₄ - u₄v₃

2. The embedding F₃ → ℂ
   Elements {0, 1, 2} can map to {1, ω, ω²} where ω = e^(2πi/3)

3. The automorphism group action
   |Aut(W33)| = 51840 includes complex phases

CP TRANSFORMATION:

In W33, CP corresponds to a specific automorphism:
  CP: vertex i → ī (some involution in Aut(W33))

CP violation occurs when the Yukawa sector
doesn't respect this involution!

6. BARYON ASYMMETRY: η ~ 10⁻¹⁰

  - F₃ structure (cube roots of unity)
  - Eigenspace asymmetry
  - See-saw with M_R ~ M_GUT
