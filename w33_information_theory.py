W33 AND THE NATURE OF INFORMATION
==================================

The deepest question: What IS information?

W33 provides a stunning answer:
  - Information = geometric structure
  - Entropy = uncertainty in holonomy
  - The universe computes itself

This script explores:
  1. W33 as an error-correcting code
  2. The holographic bound
  3. Black hole information paradox
  4. The "It from Bit" principle
  5. Observer and measurement

"It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world
has at bottom an immaterial source and explanation."

THE INSIGHT: W33 IS A CODE

In quantum error correction, information is protected by
redundancy - encoding k logical qubits into n physical qubits.

W33 structure:

  - Lines = parity checks
  - K4 components = logical operations

Classical codes:
  - Hamming(7,4): 4 bits encoded in 7 bits
  - Reed-Solomon: Used in CDs, QR codes

Quantum codes:
  - Steane [[7,1,3]]: 1 logical qubit in 7 physical
  - Surface codes: Used in quantum computers

THE DEEPEST INSIGHT:
====================

  Matter is not fundamental.
  Energy is not fundamental.
  Space is not fundamental.
  Time is not fundamental.

  INFORMATION is fundamental.

  And W33 is the structure OF information itself.

  The universe is not a thing that contains information.
  The universe IS information, organized by W33.

Wheeler was right: "It from Bit."
More precisely: "It from W(3,3)."
