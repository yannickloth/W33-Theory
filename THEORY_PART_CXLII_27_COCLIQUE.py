THE 27-COCLIQUE STRUCTURE:
==========================

The 27 non-neighbors of any vertex in Sp₄(3) induce a graph with:

  Parameters: SRG(27, 8, 1, 4)

  - 27 vertices (non-orthogonal to chosen state)
  - 108 edges (pairs orthogonal to each other)
  - Degree 8 (each state orthogonal to 8 others in the coclique)
  - λ = 1 (orthogonal pairs share 1 common orthogonal neighbor)
  - μ = 4 (non-orthogonal pairs share 4 common orthogonal neighbors)

The 27 states partition as:
  - 9 from Group 2: (1, 0, -ω^μ, -ω^ν)/√3
  - 9 from Group 3: (1, -ω^μ, 0, ω^ν)/√3
  - 9 from Group 4: (1, ω^μ, ω^ν, 0)/√3
