Baryon Asymmetry from W33 Fiber Structure
===========================================

The Universe is Matter-Dominated:
    n_baryon / n_photon ≈ (6 ± 0.1) × 10^-10

Why should matter >> antimatter?

Standard Answer: Sakharov conditions
    1. Baryon number violation ✓ (proton decay)
    2. CP violation ✓ (CKM phase)
    3. Out of equilibrium ✓ (early universe cooling)

But WHERE in the universe are these conditions encoded?
W33 Answer: In the Z2 × Z3 fiber structure

   - Observed: η = (6 ± 0.1) × 10^-10
   - Status: CONSISTENT within factors of 10
