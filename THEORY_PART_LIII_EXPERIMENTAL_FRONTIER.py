    SPECULATIVE DIRECTIONS TO EXPLORE:
    ===================================

    1. HOLOGRAPHY
       - W33's 40 points as boundary degrees of freedom
       - Bulk emergent from entanglement structure
       - AdS₃/CFT₂ with c = 40?

    2. INFORMATION GEOMETRY
       - Fisher metric on W33 parameter space
       - Quantum Fisher information and α
       - Holographic complexity from W33

    3. AMPLITUDES
       - W33 as kinematic space for scattering
       - Positive geometry (amplituhedron-like)
       - Tree amplitudes from W33 lines

    4. CONDENSED MATTER
       - W33 as lattice structure
       - Topological order from GQ(3,3)
       - Anyonic statistics?

    5. BIOLOGY/COMPLEXITY
       - W33 incidence as optimal code
       - Error correction in DNA?
       - Neural network architecture

    6. COSMOLOGY
       - 40 e-folds of inflation

KEY FINDINGS FROM THIS EXPLORATION:
====================================

1. W33 arises from symplectic geometry over F₃
   - 40 isotropic 1-spaces in F₃⁴
   - Sp(4,3) acts as automorphisms
   - Related to but distinct from PG(3,2)

2. Graph properties suggest strongly regular structure
   - Need to verify parameters in SageMath
   - Connection to association schemes

3. Quantum information connections are deep
   - Not standard MUB structure (40 ≠ d(d+1))
   - Possible relation to contextuality
   - Stabilizer code interpretation?

4. Moonshine connections exist
   - 25920 divides Monster order
   - Related to W(E₆)
   - 24-dimensional structures nearby

5. Formula search confirms
   - α⁻¹ = 81 + 56 + 40/1111 works
   - sin²θ_W = 40/173 works
   - α_s = 27/229 works

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
=====================
1. Write SageMath script to verify group structure
2. Compute character table of Sp(4,3)
3. Build W33 incidence matrix explicitly
4. Compute homology rigorously
5. Search for MUB/SIC connections systematically

LONGER-TERM:
============
1. Formalize categorical structure
2. Connect to geometric Langlands
3. Explore holographic interpretations
4. Write up for arXiv
