# W33 Theory of Everything — Proof-Style Synthesis (Jan 26, 2026)

This is a compact proof-style synthesis of the W33 framework as documented in this
repository. It organizes the core claims into axioms, definitions, lemmas, and
verification checkpoints, and points to the scripts/results that reproduce the
computations.

## 0. Scope and Conventions

- Base field: F3 = {0,1,2} (sometimes written {-1,0,+1}).
- Vector space: V = F3^4, equipped with a non-degenerate symplectic form ω.
- Projective space: PG(3,3) is the 3D projective space over F3.
- W(3,3) is the symplectic polar space of totally isotropic subspaces in PG(3,3).
- W33 denotes the point graph of W(3,3).

---

## 1. Axioms (Framework Assumptions)

**A0 (Phase space):** V = F3^4 is the minimal discrete phase space.

**A1 (Symplectic structure):** V carries a non-degenerate alternating form ω.

**A2 (Isotropy):** Points/lines are totally isotropic subspaces of PG(3,3).

**A3 (Graph object):** W33 is the point graph of W(3,3).

These axioms are the formal starting point for the construction chain:

F3 → V=F3^4 → (V,ω) → W(3,3) → W33.

---

## 2. Definitions

**D1 (Generalized quadrangle):** W(3,3) is the symplectic generalized quadrangle of order (3,3).

**D2 (Point graph):** W33 is the graph whose vertices are points of W(3,3), with edges
connecting collinear points.

**D3 (Strongly regular graph):** W33 is an SRG with parameters (v,k,λ,μ).

---

## 3. Core Lemmas (Structural Facts)

**L1 (Basic parameters).** W33 has v=40 vertices, k=12 degree, λ=2, μ=4.

**L2 (Incidence counts).** W(3,3) has 40 points and 40 lines, with **4 lines through each
point** and **4 points on each line** (order (3,3)).

**L3 (Edge count).** W33 has 240 edges.

**L4 (Spectrum).** The adjacency spectrum is {12^1, 2^24, (-4)^15}.

**L5 (Automorphisms).** Full incidence symmetry:
|Aut_inc(W(3,3))| = 51,840 = |Sp(4,3)| = |W(E6)|.
Point-graph symmetry:
|Aut_pts(W33)| = 25,920 = |PSp(4,3)| (index 2).

**L6 (Homology link).** The construction yields H1 dimension 81 in the documented
clique-complex computations.

---

## 4. Principal Theorem (Geometric Backbone)

**T1 (W33 Uniqueness and Structure).** The axioms A0–A3 uniquely determine the point
graph W33 as the symplectic generalized quadrangle GQ(3,3) with SRG parameters
(v,k,λ,μ) = (40,12,2,4).

*Evidence:* Computed adjacency structure, spectrum, and automorphism group align
with the documented W33 invariants and Sage verification outputs in this repo.

---

## 5. Exceptional Lie Algebra Interface (E6/E7/E8)

**T2 (Root-count correspondence).** The 240 edges of W33 correspond to the 240 roots of E8.

**T3 (Group-order coincidence).** |Aut(W33)| = 51,840 = |W(E6)|.

These are the combinatorial anchors used throughout the E6/E7/E8 decomposition
claims in the theory documents.

**L7 (E6 orbit decomposition of E8 roots).** Under the standard E6-in-E8 embedding,
the action of W(E6) splits the E8 root set into:
```
240 = 72 + 27 + 27 + 27 + 27 + 27 + 27 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```
This matches the E6 x SU(3) decomposition:
```
240 = 72 (E6 roots) + 6 (SU3 roots) + 27x3 + 27bar x 3bar
```

**C1 (Equivariance obstruction).** PSp(4,3) acts transitively on W33 edges (single
orbit of size 240), but its realizations inside W(E8) act on a 27-orbit, not on the
full 240 roots. Therefore a single-orbit equivariant bijection
W33 edges -> E8 roots does not exist under PSp(4,3) alone. The correct equivariant
object is the 27-sector (H27) lifted across the SU(3) phase classes.

**Construction (explicit bijection).** An explicit, deterministic W33 edge -> E8 root
bijection aligned with the E6 x SU(3) decomposition is given in:
```
artifacts/explicit_bijection_decomposition.json
```
and constructed by:
```
tools/explicit_bijection_decomposition.py
```

## 6. Computational Verification (Reproducibility Map)

The following scripts and outputs provide the computational checks that ground
L1–L6 and the numeric predictions:

- `w33_baseline_audit.py` and `w33_baseline_audit_suite.py`
  - Local invariant checks and cross-validation.

- `w33_sage_incidence_and_h1.py` (output used by `show_results.py`)
  - Writes `data/w33_sage_incidence_h1.json` (group order, H1 dimension, etc.).

- `tools/sage_e8_orbit_f3_mapping.py`
  - Writes `artifacts/e8_orbit_to_f3_point.json`
  - Explicit coordinate lift: E8 Coxeter orbits → F₃⁴ projective points.

- `sage_verify.py`
  - Produces `PART_CXIII_sagemath_verification.json` (Sage verification summary).

- `tools/build_final_summary_table.py`
  - Produces `artifacts/final_summary_table.md` and
    `artifacts/final_summary_table.json` (prediction tables used in
    `FINAL_THEORY_SUMMARY.md`).

- `tools/e6_we6_orbit_refined.py`
  - Produces `artifacts/e6_we6_orbit_refined.json` (E6 orbit decomposition of E8).

- `tools/explicit_bijection_decomposition.py`
  - Produces `artifacts/explicit_bijection_decomposition.json`
    (explicit W33 edge -> E8 root mapping).

```
python3 tools/build_final_summary_table.py
python3 w33_baseline_audit.py

## 8. Summary

The axioms A0–A3 define W33 as a finite symplectic geometry with a fixed, unique
combinatorial structure. The repo provides computational verification of the
core invariants and a numeric prediction table generated directly from the
model formulas. This document is the proof-style map tying those pieces into a
single, reproducible chain.
