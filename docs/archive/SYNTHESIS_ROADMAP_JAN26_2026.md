# W33 Theory of Everything - Synthesis and Roadmap (Jan 26, 2026)

This note integrates:
- external math facts (with citations in the companion chat report),
- verified repo outputs from the latest Sage runs,
- and a set of concrete, testable hypotheses that would move W33 from
  numerological matching toward structural physics.

It does NOT claim the theory is proven in nature; it lays out the strongest
mathematical spine and the next experiments/derivations needed.

---

## 1) External Math Facts Used as Grounding

A) Generalized quadrangles GQ(s,t):
- Points per line = s+1, lines per point = t+1
- Total points = (s+1)(st+1)
- Total lines  = (t+1)(st+1)
- Collinearity graph parameters:
  v = (s+1)(st+1), k = s(t+1), lambda = s-1, mu = t+1

B) Symplectic polar space W(3,q):
- It is a generalized quadrangle with s=t=q

C) E8 root system:
- 240 roots in the E8 root system

D) Witting configuration:
- A 40-point configuration with incidence parameters displayed as
  [40 12 12; 2 240 2; 12 12 40]

E) Pauli group geometry (qubits):
- The geometry of N-qubit Pauli groups is embodied in a symplectic polar space
  W(2N-1,2); maximal commuting sets correspond to maximal totally isotropic
  subspaces

## 2) Repo-Verified Invariants (Latest Sage Run)

From the Docker Sage suite run on 2026-01-26:

- W33 graph (SymplecticPolarGraph(4,3)):
  - vertices = 40
  - edges = 240
  - SRG parameters = (40,12,2,4)
  - eigenvalues = 12 (mult 1), 2 (mult 24), -4 (mult 15)
  - |Aut(W33)| = 51840

- E8 root count comparison:
  - W33 edges = 240
  - E8 roots = 240

- Clique and incidence checks (LIV):
  - 40 cliques of size 4 (lines)
  - complement SRG(40,27,18,18)
  - homology H1 = Z^81

- CXVIII explicit construction:
  - Reye configuration found: (12_4, 16_3)
  - Stabilizer orbits on 39 vertices: [12, 27]
  - Found decomposition 40 = 1 + 12 + 27
  - H12 subgraph is SRG(12,2,1,0)

- CXIX 27 non-neighbors:
  - H27 edges = 108, degree = 8
  - stabilizer order = 1296 (2^4 * 3^4)
  - eigenvalues: 8^1, -4^6, -1^8, 2^12
  - H27 adjacency is determined by W33 common-neighbor counts (2 vs 4)

- H12 neighbor subgraph (D4 signal):
  - Each H12 decomposes into 4 disjoint triangles (12 = 4×3)
  - Aligns with the λ=2 eigenspace multiplicity 24 (D4 root count)
  - Each H27 vertex connects to exactly one vertex in each H12 triangle
    (pattern (1,1,1,1), uniform across bases)
  - Triangle-choice tuples collapse to 9 types (each realized by 3 vertices)
  - The 9 tuples form an affine F3^2 plane (rank 2)
  - Fibers are independent sets; every pair of fibers has 3 edges (perfect matching)
  - No triangle labeling yields 27 distinct tuples (so no affine/Latin cube model)
  - Linear equations for the 9-tuples: 2x0+2x1+x2=0 and x0+2x1+x3=0
  - Z3 labeling exists that makes all inter-fiber matchings translations,
    but translation constants are not difference-invariant
  - Explicit edge rule: c(u,v) = u2*v1 + 2*u1*v2 (mod 3)
    so (u,z)~(v,w) iff w = z + c(u,v) and u != v
  - Verified full Heisenberg model: H27 ≅ Cayley(H(3), {(t,0)})
    with automorphism structure Z3 × AGL(2,3) (order 1296)
  - Explicit automorphisms: u' = A u + b, z' = det(A) z − B(Au,b) + c
  - H12 triangles correspond to linear forms on F3^2: u1, u2, u1+u2, u1+2u2
  - Full local reconstruction: W33 = {v0} ⊔ (PG(1,3)×F3) ⊔ (Heisenberg H(3))
    with H12–H27 incidence defined by those linear forms
  - Concrete vertex table produced for the 40-point model

- Triangle co-occurrence graph:
  - 160 triangle vertices, 240 edges (degree 3)
  - Disjoint union of 40 K4 components (one per base vertex)
  - Spectrum: 3^40, (−1)^120
  - Line graph has 240 vertices, degree 4, nullspace dim 120

- λ=2 eigenspace separation:
  - Vertex projections separate adjacency exactly (ip 0.1 vs −0.0667)
  - Edge projections all equal norm but do not form an E8 root system
  - Closed form projector: P2 = (2/3) I + (1/6) A − (1/15) J

- SRG(40,12,2,4) enumeration (Spence dataset):
  - 28 non-isomorphic graphs
  - exactly one graph is isomorphic to W33
  - two graphs share |Aut| = 51840 and 40 max 4-cliques, but only one is W33

- 2‑qutrit Pauli commutation geometry (F3^4):
  - points = 40, edges = 240, SRG(40,12,2,4)
  - 40 lines of size 4, 4 lines per point
  - triangles = 160

- E8 adjacency test vs W33 line graph:
  - W33 line graph degree 22, E8 root adjacency graphs degree 56
  - line graph not isomorphic to either inner‑product (±1) E8 root graph

- Alternative edge‑relation search (E8 mapping attempt):
  - classified edge‑pairs by (shared endpoints, cross‑adjacencies)
  - no class or class‑union yields degree 56 or 126 with E8 spectra
  - only degree‑22 union is the standard line‑graph relation

- Witting vs E8 (realified comparison):
  - 240 Witting vertices (40 rays × 6 phases) realified to R^8
  - inner products include ±1.1547 and ±0.57735, not present in E8
  - neighbor counts at ip=±1,0 do not match E8 (56, 126)
  - indicates the naive realification is not an E8 root system

- E8 root-line orthogonal triple partition:
  - 120 root lines partitioned into 40 triples of mutually orthogonal lines
  - each triple corresponds to an octahedron (6 roots) in the E8 orthogonality graph
  - provides a concrete 40‑block structure compatible with W33’s 40 lines
  - however, relation counts between these 40 blocks do not yield an SRG(40,12,2,4)

- Full inner‑product relation search on triples:
  - 10 relation classes based on 6×6 inner‑product counts
  - no SRG(40,12,2,4) candidates found
  - triple type patterns: 20×(0,3), 18×(3,0), 2×(1,2)

- Randomized partition search:
  - deeper orthogonality‑count search (50 tries, 400k nodes/try): none yielded SRG(40,12,2,4)
  - full 6×6 inner‑product search (limited unions): none yielded SRG(40,12,2,4)
  - pattern‑constrained search (20×(0,3), 18×(3,0), 2×(1,2)) also failed

- Composite triple‑relation search:
  - 33 composite classes (triple type pattern + full 6×6 inner‑product counts)
  - no SRG(40,12,2,4) candidates found for unions up to size 4

- Trace‑map test (GF(4) → GF(2)):
  - coordinatewise trace on 40 Witting base states yields 6 projective points
  - indicates the modeled vertex set is incomplete for the published PG(3,2) map

- Trace‑map test (full 240 Witting vertices):
  - 15 unique GF(2) points with uniform multiplicity 16
  - matches the published GF(4)→GF(2) trace‑map collapse for Witting vertices

- Witting ray trace‑map analysis:
  - 8 rays map to 1 PG(3,2) point; 32 rays map to 3 points
  - one PG point is uncovered by ray images
  - W33 line unions in PG(3,2) have sizes 4, 5, 8, or 10

- PG(3,2) fiber structure (240 vertices):
  - each of 15 PG points has 16 vertices (8 unique GF(4) vectors)
  - orthogonality graphs on the 8‑vertex cores are not uniform cubes

- PG(3,2) relation search:
  - 6 relation classes from ray trace‑image intersections
  - no union reproduces W33 adjacency

- W33 line unions vs PG(3,2) lines:
  - no W33 line maps exactly to a PG(3,2) line
  - PG lines are covered unevenly (0–17 W33 lines per line)
  - each W33 line union contains 0, 1, 7, or 8 PG lines

- W33 line unions vs PG(3,2) planes:
  - 16 unions contain exactly one PG plane (Fano 7‑point)
  - 24 unions contain none; no ovoid‑like unions

- Ray images as PG(3,2) lines:
  - all 3‑point ray images are PG lines, but only 16 distinct lines are hit
  - only 4 distinct isotropic lines are hit (8 rays total)

- Incidence‑relation search:
  - no union of point/line or line/line relations reproduces W33 adjacency

- W33 line → PG(3,2) plane cover:
  - 16 W33 lines contain exactly one PG plane
  - 8 planes are covered by 2 lines; 7 planes are uncovered

- PG(3,2) lines hit by ray images:
  - 16 lines cover 14 points (one point uncovered)
  - point degrees split 3 or 4 (8 points degree 3, 6 points degree 4)
  - line intersection graph is not regular (degrees 7 or 9)

- Hit‑line spread search:
  - no spread or 14‑point partial spread exists inside the 16 hit lines

- Configuration invariants:
  - 14‑point/16‑line incidence graph has mixed point degrees (3,4) and non‑SRG spectrum

- Configuration automorphisms:
  - automorphism group order: 48 (partition‑preserving on points/lines)
  - point orbits: sizes 6 and 8
  - line orbits: sizes 4 and 12
  - full automorphism group also has order 48 (no point/line swapping)

- GL(4,2) stabilizer check:
  - same order (48) and same orbit sizes as the incidence automorphism group
  - fixes the missing point 1111, so all configuration symmetries appear geometric

- Alternating-form exhaustive search:
  - 28 nondegenerate alternating forms on F2^4
  - best isotropic hit count is 12/16, no exact match

- Quadratic-form rule search:
  - 2048 quadratic forms tested with count-based line selection
  - no exact rule reproduces the 16 hit lines
  - best overlap includes all 16 but selects 25 total lines (Jaccard 0.64)

- Line-space (Plücker) analysis:
  - embedded lines into PG(5,2) Klein quadric via Plücker coordinates
  - no linear hyperplane yields exactly the 16 hit lines (best overlap 12/16)
  - no quadratic form yields exact match; best quadratic selects 20 lines including all 16

- Stabilizer orbit decomposition:
  - line orbits sizes: 12, 12, 4, 4, 3
  - hit lines = one 12‑orbit + one 4‑orbit
  - point orbits sizes: 8, 6, 1 (missing point fixed)

- Orbit intersection scheme:
  - orbit‑pair intersection counts are uniform (min=max) across all lines
  - suggests a small association scheme on the 35 lines

- Orbit incidence table:
  - point-orbit/line-orbit incidence counts are uniform
  - hit lines avoid the fixed point 1111 entirely
  - covered 8‑orbit vs 6‑orbit points have distinct incidence profiles

- Line-orbit compositions:
  - 12‑orbits (hit + non-hit) have composition (2 from 8‑orbit, 1 from 6‑orbit)
  - 4‑hit‑orbit lines lie entirely in the 6‑orbit
  - non-hit 4/3 orbits are the lines through the fixed point

- Weight-class characterization:
  - hit lines are exactly those with weight pattern (1,2,3) or (2,2,2)
  - the 6 weight‑2 points form a 6‑point/4‑line tetrahedral subgeometry (K4 edge‑vertex incidence)

- Ray-level GF(4) rule:
  - (1,1,1,1) in GF(4) entries (one 0 + one each of 1, ω, ω²) ⇒ (2,2,2) lines
  - one 0 + a repeated nonzero ⇒ (1,2,3) lines
  - special point cases: (3,1,0,0) ⇒ weight‑1 point; (1,3,0,0) ⇒ weight‑3 point

- Tetrahedral rays:
  - exactly 8 rays map to the 4 (2,2,2) tetrahedral lines (two rays per line)
  - the 4 lines are explicitly enumerated in `artifacts/witting_pg32_tetrahedral_rays.md`

- Simple GF(4) invariants:
  - product of nonzero entries = 1 ⇔ tetrahedral (2,2,2) rays
  - product of nonzero entries = ω or ω² ⇔ (1,2,3) line rays
  - sum of nonzero entries = 0 ⇔ tetrahedral class

- W33 alignment of tetrahedral rays:
  - reconstructed all 40 W33 lines from Hermitian orthogonality
  - every W33 line has 0 or 2 tetrahedral rays (never 1,3,4)
  - 16 lines have 2 tetra rays; 24 lines have none
  - tetrahedral rays induce a regular 8‑vertex subgraph (degree 4)

- Tetrahedral subgraph:
  - induced subgraph is bipartite with 4+4 split and 16 edges
  - therefore isomorphic to K4,4

- W33 line trace signature:
  - tetra-bearing lines split into two trace-union classes
  - 4 lines: tetra rays from same tetra PG line → union size 5
  - 12 lines: tetra rays from two distinct tetra PG lines → union size 10

- Polarity search (GL(4,2) basis changes):
  - best found: 12 of 16 hit lines become isotropic under a suitable symplectic form

- Augmented lines (add missing‑point lines):
  - 23 lines total; point cover counts {4:8, 5:6, 7:1}
  - line‑intersection degree set {10, 12, 14} (still non‑regular)

## 3) Minimal Mathematical Spine

A1) Assume discrete phase space: V = F3^4 with a non-degenerate symplectic form.
A2) Form W(3,3) as the symplectic polar space of totally isotropic subspaces.
A3) Define W33 as the collinearity graph of GQ(3,3).

From external facts A/B and formulas in Section 1:
- s=t=3 => v=40 points, 40 lines, SRG(40,12,2,4).

This matches the repo-verified invariants exactly.

---

## 4) Hypotheses That Move Toward Physics (Testable)

H1) Unique physics graph within SRG(40,12,2,4).
- There are 28 non-isomorphic SRG(40,12,2,4) graphs (external fact).
- Hypothesis: W33 is singled out by symplectic polarity + automorphism group
  order 51840 + existence of 40 lines of size 4.
- Test: compare invariants of all 28 graphs against symplectic constraints.
- Status: completed enumeration; only one graph is isomorphic to W33.

H2) E8 correspondence is structural, not just numeric.
- Hypothesis: There exists a bijection from W33 edges to E8 roots that preserves
  adjacency or root inner-product structure.
- Test: build explicit mapping and verify inner products and orbit structure.
- Status: line-graph adjacency does not match E8 root adjacency (degree mismatch).
  Simple edge‑relation unions also fail to match E8 adjacency or orthogonality.
  The standard realification of Witting vertices also fails to match E8.
  A new positive lead: E8 root lines can be partitioned into 40 orthogonal triples,
  yielding 40 octahedra that mirror W33’s 40 line blocks (6 edges each).
  But the naive block‑relation graph on those 40 triples does **not** reproduce
  SRG(40,12,2,4), so the line‑incidence structure is still missing.

H3) Matter decomposition from local orbits.
- Hypothesis: 40 = 1 + 12 + 27 corresponds to singlet + gauge sector + E6
  fundamental (Jordan algebra J3(O)).
- Test: define an algebraic product on the 27 non-neighbors (H27) and verify
  Jordan identities or E6 action in Aut(W33) stabilizer.

H4) Contextuality link via symplectic geometry.
- For qubits, Pauli groups map to symplectic polar spaces W(2N-1,2).
- Hypothesis: two-qutrit Pauli geometry is modeled by W(3,3) (F3^4).
- Test: construct the qutrit Pauli group, map commutation to symplectic form,
  compare contexts with W33 lines and cliques.
- Status: commutation geometry on projective F3^4 reproduces SRG(40,12,2,4),
  40 lines of size 4, and 160 triangles.

H5) Predictive constants must survive baseline audits.
- Baseline audit results show many low-complexity expressions approximate targets.
- Hypothesis: W33 formulas remain significant under pre-registered, locked
  prediction sets and null-model controls.
- Test: pre-register target list, run baseline audit vs. randomized graph data.

---

## 5) Next Computational Tasks (Concrete)

1) Go beyond edge‑pair relations for the E8 correspondence:
   - test relations induced by **root subsystems**, orbit‑stabilizers,
     or incidence with the 120‑root shell rather than endpoint combinatorics.
   - refine the 40‑triple partition to align with W33 line‑incidence structure
     (not just a block count).

2) Extract explicit symplectic polarity constraints that distinguish W33 from
   the other SRG(40,12,2,4) graphs (beyond clique counts and |Aut|).

3) Expand the Pauli‑geometry test: compare contextuality configurations
   (Mermin‑Peres type) and maximal commuting sets directly.

4) Add a pre-registered prediction harness that uses frozen experimental
   values and reports significance vs. baseline audits.

---

## 6) Bottom Line

The W33 framework is mathematically coherent as a finite symplectic geometry.
The strongest verified pieces are the SRG(40,12,2,4) structure, automorphism
order 51840, and the combinatorial decompositions (1+12+27, 40 lines, etc.).

The physics interpretation remains a hypothesis requiring explicit structure
preservation (especially the E8 mapping and Pauli-group commutation geometry).

This roadmap states the minimal set of proofs/tests needed to elevate the
framework from a numerological synthesis to a falsifiable mathematical
physics program.
