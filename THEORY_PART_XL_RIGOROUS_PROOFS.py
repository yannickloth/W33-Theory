CLAIM: The automorphism group of the W(3,3) configuration has order 51,840,

PROOF:

Step 1: Define W(3,3)
─────────────────────
W(3,3) is the configuration of external points with respect to an oval
in the projective plane PG(2,3).

PG(2,3) has:
  - 13 points
  - 13 lines
  - Each line contains 4 points
  - Each point lies on 4 lines

An oval in PG(2,3) is a set of q+1 = 4 points, no three collinear.
The EXTERNAL points are those not on the oval.

Number of external points: 13 - 4 = 9?

Wait - let's be more careful. In PG(2,3):
  - Oval has 4 points
  - Through each external point pass 0, 1, or 2 tangent lines
  - "External" means external to the oval's tangent structure

Actually, W(3,3) is defined differently. Let me use the standard definition:

W(3,3) is the WITTS configuration, named after Ernst Witt.
