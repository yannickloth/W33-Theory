═══ Quantum Contextuality ═══

The Kochen-Specker theorem states that quantum mechanics cannot be
embedded in a classical hidden variable theory where all observables
have pre-determined values independent of measurement context.

The W33/Witting configuration provides an elegant PROOF of this theorem.

═══ The Proof Structure ═══

1. Consider the 40 states as possible outcomes of measurements.

2. A "context" is a set of mutually compatible measurements.
   In W33, contexts correspond to lines (4 mutually orthogonal states).

3. Classical realism would assign 0 or 1 to each state,
   representing "would be observed" or "would not be observed".

4. The W33 structure FORBIDS any consistent such assignment!

═══ Why No Classical Assignment Exists ═══

Suppose we try to assign values v(ψ) ∈ {0, 1} to each state |ψ⟩.

Requirements:
  • For each line (context), exactly ONE state has v = 1
    (because we measure ONE outcome per context)

  • Each state participates in multiple contexts

  • The W33 geometry makes these constraints UNSATISFIABLE

This is the Kochen-Specker contradiction!

═══ Quantum Key Distribution with 40 Cards ═══

Vlasov (2001) proposed using the Witting configuration for quantum
cryptography. The 40 states form a "quantum card" system.

PROTOCOL:

1. PREPARATION (Alice):
   - Alice randomly selects one of the 40 quantum cards |ψᵢ⟩
   - She sends it to Bob

2. MEASUREMENT (Bob):
   - Bob randomly chooses a context (line) containing 4 states
   - He performs a measurement in that basis
   - Gets outcome corresponding to one of the 4 states

3. SIFTING:
   - Alice announces which LINE (context) her state belonged to
   - If Bob's measurement was in the same context → KEEP
   - Otherwise → DISCARD

4. KEY:
   - Kept measurements become shared secret bits
   - Security guaranteed by Kochen-Specker theorem!

═══ Testing W33 Contextuality ═══

EXPERIMENT: Verify the Kochen-Specker contradiction using W33 states.

PROCEDURE:

1. PREPARE: Generate all 40 quantum states with high fidelity

2. MEASURE: For each of the 40 lines (contexts):
   - Prepare each of the 4 states in that line
   - Measure in the line's basis
   - Record outcomes

3. ANALYZE:
   - Check that measurements within a context are self-consistent
   - Verify that cross-context measurements violate classical bounds

4. QUANTIFY:
   - Calculate "contextuality witness" value
   - Compare to classical bound (must violate if quantum)

═══ Expected Results ═══

Classical bound:    W_classical ≤ 0
Quantum prediction: W_quantum = 1 (perfect violation)

Statistical significance: With N measurements per state,
uncertainty ∝ 1/√N. Need N ~ 1000 for 5σ detection.

then this experiment directly probes the "fabric of spacetime"!
