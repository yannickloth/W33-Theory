THEORY PART CXXXIII: NAMING CONVENTION AND GQ(3,3) STRUCTURE
=============================================================

We establish the proper naming for our graph and explore its GQ(3,3) structure.

STANDARD NAMES (from Brouwer's database):
=========================================

The graph SRG(40, 12, 2, 4) has these standard names:
1. Sp(4,3) - Symplectic polar graph over F_3
2. O(5,3) - Orthogonal polar graph (isomorphic)
3. GQ(3,3) - Incidence graph of generalized quadrangle

The Witting configuration provides ONE REALIZATION:
- 40 rays in CP^3 with orthogonality forming this graph

NAMING DECISION:
================

Since Sp(4,3) is the most standard name, we adopt:

  Sp₄(3) = SRG(40, 12, 2, 4)

The "W33" name we used was informal. The graph IS the orthogonality
graph of the Witting configuration, but Sp(4,3) is the canonical name.

GQ(3,3) INTERPRETATION:
=======================

A generalized quadrangle GQ(s,t) is an incidence structure where:
- Each point is on t+1 lines
- Each line has s+1 points
- Two points are on at most one line
- For point p not on line L, exactly one line through p meets L

For GQ(3,3):
- Points: 40 (= (3+1)(3·3+1) = 4×10)
- Lines: 40 (= (3+1)(3·3+1) - same by duality!)
- Each point on 4 lines
- Each line has 4 points
- The collinearity graph is Sp₄(3)

The 40 lines correspond to the 40 ORTHONORMAL BASES we found!

Why F₃? The Symplectic Structure:
================================

Sp₄(3) comes from the symplectic group over F₃:
- Start with V = F₃⁴ (4-dimensional vector space over field with 3 elements)
- Equip with symplectic form ⟨x,y⟩ = x₁y₃ - x₃y₁ + x₂y₄ - x₄y₂
- Isotropic vectors: ⟨x,x⟩ = 0
- Isotropic 1-spaces: 40 of them (our vertices)
- Two isotropic 1-spaces are adjacent if their span is isotropic

The count:
- |F₃⁴| = 81 vectors
- Remove 0: 80 nonzero vectors
- Each 1-space has 2 nonzero vectors
- Not all are isotropic; counting gives 40
