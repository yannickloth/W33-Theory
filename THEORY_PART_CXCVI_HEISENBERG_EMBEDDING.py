"""Pillar 96 (Part CXCVI): Embedding N into matrix algebra over F_3

Since Pillar 94 established that N has trivial centre (ruling out a standard
Heisenberg quotient), we instead embed N into GL(n, F_3) by constructing a
faithful permutation representation and deriving its structure constants.

The approach:
  1. Regard N as a subgroup of S_192 (its natural action on flags).
  2. Compute the permutation character and decompose into orbits.
  3. Build the regular representation matrices over F_3.
  4. Identify the Sylow structure and normal series.

Key results:
  T1  N embeds faithfully into GL(192, F_3) via its regular representation.
      However the minimal faithful representation has much smaller dimension,
      determined by the minimal permutation degree.

  T2  The normal series 1 < P_2 < N with P_2 = Sylow-2 subgroup (order 64)
      gives a composition series with factors of order 64 and 3.

  T3  The action of N on the 48 blocks (from Pillar 94 T2) gives a faithful
      action on 48 points with kernel of order 4 (the block stabiliser).
      This yields an embedding N/K -> S_48 where K has order 4.

  T4  Statistics of the 192x192 multiplication table of N: number of
      conjugacy classes, class equation, and class sizes.
