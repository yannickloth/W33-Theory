PREDICTION FOR W(5, 3):
-----------------------
Based on Solomon-Tits theorem:
  H₂(W(5, 3)) = Steinberg representation
  dim(Steinberg) = 3^9 = 19,683

The building for Sp(6, 3) has dimension 2 (rank - 1 = 3 - 1).
So H₂ is the top homology, where Steinberg lives!

Unlike W(3, 3):
  - H₁(W(5, 3)) = 0 (not 81!)
  - π₁(W(5, 3)) is NOT free
  - W(5, 3) is NOT aspherical
  - W(5, 3) has interesting π₂

This is a fundamentally different topology from W(3, 3)!

But we need to see the W(3, 3) structure more directly.

Consider the "MUB graph":
  - Vertices = rays (one-dimensional subspaces)
  - Edges = pairs from different MUBs
  
Actually, the deeper connection is:

The LINES of W(3, 3) correspond to certain "MUB lines":
  - Each line has 4 points
  - These 4 points come from 4 different MUBs!

1. The 4 MUBs in C³ come from GF(3)² (2D over finite field)
2. W(3, 3) = geometry of GF(3)⁴ = (GF(3)²)²
3. The Wigner function on discrete phase space uses W(3, 3)!
4. Contextuality proofs use W(3, 3) structure
