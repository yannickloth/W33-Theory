W33 π₁ Puzzle - Reconciling with H₁

The calculation showed:
  rank(π₁(1-skeleton)) = 201 (free group)
  triangles = 160 (relations)

So π₁ should have (201 - 160) = 41 generators mod relations?
But H₁ = Z^81!

Wait - this isn't how it works. Let me redo this properly.

The formula "rank = edges - vertices + 1 - triangles" is WRONG.

The correct computation is:

We found:
  rank(∂₁) = 39  (so dim(ker ∂₁) = 240 - 39 = 201)

Therefore:

The error before was assuming each triangle contributes one "relation".
But triangles can give DEPENDENT relations!

In fact: 160 triangles, but only 120 independent boundary relations.
The 40 "missing" relations come from the tetrahedra!

Each tetrahedron's boundary is 4 triangles, giving a "zero relation".
40 tetrahedra × 1 relation each = 40 dependencies.
So: 160 - 40 = 120 independent triangle boundaries. ✓

The homology calculation is correct:
  H₁(W33) = Z^81

The apparent discrepancy came from naive counting.
The proper calculation uses linear algebra on boundary matrices.

For the fundamental group:
  π₁(W33) has generators and relations
  π₁^ab = H₁ = Z^81

So π₁(W33) could be:
  1. Abelian (π₁ = Z^81)
  2. Non-abelian with Z^81 as abelianization
