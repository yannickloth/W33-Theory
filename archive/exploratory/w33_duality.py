W33 Fundamental Group Analysis

Now that we know H₁(W33) = Z^81 (Steinberg), what about π₁(W33)?
For a simplicial complex, π₁ can be computed from the 1-skeleton
with relations from 2-simplices.

Also: the 40+40 symmetry between points and lines suggests
there might be a self-duality. Let's explore this!
