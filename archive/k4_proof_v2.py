K4 PROOF VERSION 2: Understanding the Constraint

Key observation from previous run:
- Point 0 = e0 (standard basis)
- For K4 containing 0: phases from 0 are all k=0
- The other 3 points have phases {3, 9} among themselves
- Pattern: 0 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 6 or 0 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 6

For general K4 (not containing 0):
- More varied phases, but still sum to 6

The key question: What algebraic constraint forces this?

HYPOTHESIS: The outer quad P, living in the orthogonal complement of center C,
must satisfy specific phase relationships due to the dimension constraint.
