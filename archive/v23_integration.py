V23 INTEGRATION: Connecting my K4/-1 proof with the fiber6 field equation

The v23 bundle proves the following EXACT field equation:
- For Q = 45-node quotient (complement of GQ(4,2) point graph)
- For any triangle (u,v,w) in Q:

  | centers(u,v,w) | Z2 parity | fiber6 holonomy | count |
  |----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
  | 0 (acentric)   | 0         | (3,1,1,1)       | 2880  |
  | 1 (unicentric) | 1         | (2,2,2)         | 2160  |
  | 3 (tricentric) | 0         | identity        | 240   |

KEY INSIGHT: The fiber6 = Z2 x {0,1,2} = sheet x port bundle is the correct
structure to encode the spin structure on W33.

MY K4/-1 PROOF CONNECTION:
- K4 components in W33 have Bargmann phase -1
- This is a Berry phase from CP^2 simplex geometry
- The 90 K4 components in W33 should relate to the 45 Q-vertices somehow

Let me explore this connection.

    SYNTHESIS:

    1. W33 Structure (my findings):
       - 40 points = unit vectors in C^4
       - Collinear = orthogonal (<p|q> = 0)
       - Non-collinear = equiangular (|<p|q>| = 1/sqrt(3))
       - Phases are Z_12 = Z_4 x Z_3 (quaternionic x color)
       - 90 K4 components, each with Bargmann phase -1

    2. GQ(4,2)/Q45 Structure (v23 findings):
       - 45 vertices in quotient Q
       - 5280 triangles with 3 types (by centers)
       - Fiber bundle: F = Z_2 x {0,1,2} (sheet x port)
       - Exact field equation: centers -> parity -> holonomy cycle type

    3. The Connection:
       - W33 has 40 points, GQ(4,2) has 45 points
       - The 90-scheme quotient maps W33 -> Q45
       - K4 components in W33 correspond to... what in Q45?

    4. The Physics Picture:
       - The fiber F = Z_2 x Z_3 resembles weak isospin x color
       - The holonomy types: id (trivial), 3-cycle (rotation), (2,2,2) (reflection)
       - This is the structure group of a spin/gauge bundle!

    5. The -1 Mystery:
       - My Bargmann phase -1 comes from CP^2 simplex geometry
       - The v23 (2,2,2) holonomy comes from unicentric triads
       - Both involve "fermion-like" sign flips under transport
       - Are they the same phenomenon seen from different angles?

    Both phenomena reflect the same underlying structure:
    a discrete spin-gauge bundle over the GQ(4,2) geometry
    with nontrivial holonomy dictated by topological constraints.

    The "theory of everything" kernel is:
    - Base space: GQ(4,2) quotient Q45
