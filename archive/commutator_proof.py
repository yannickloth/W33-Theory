WHY IS THE BARGMANN 4-CYCLE ALWAYS -1?

This is the central mystery. Let me work through this algebraically.

The Bargmann 4-cycle for a move swapping c->d while keeping {a,b} fixed:
    <c|a><a|d><d|b><b|c> = -1/9

Note: The VALUE is -1/9, not -1. The PHASE is -1.
Since all magnitudes are 1/3, and 4 inner products multiply: (1/3)^4... wait no.

Actually: |<p|q>| = 1/sqrt(3) for all non-collinear pairs.
So the magnitude is (1/sqrt(3))^4 = 1/9. Check!

The phase being exactly pi (i.e., -1) is the deep fact.

Let me prove this algebraically.
