THEORETICAL PREDICTION:
-----------------------
For W(5, 3) = symplectic polar space of rank 3:

Building dimension = rank - 1 = 2

By Solomon-Tits theorem:
  H_i(Building) = 0 for i < dim
  H_{dim}(Building) = Steinberg representation

Therefore:
  H_0(W(5, 3)) = Z
  H_1(W(5, 3)) = 0
  H_2(W(5, 3)) = Z^{19683} (Steinberg!)

Root system C_3 has 3² = 9 positive roots
dim(Steinberg) = 3^9 = 19,683

Unlike W(3, 3):
  - H_1 = 0 (not Z^81)
  - π_1 is NOT free (may be trivial or finite)
  - Interesting π_2

COMPARISON:
-----------
W(3, 3):
  - 40 points, 40 lines
  - χ = -80
  - H_1 = Z^81, H_2 = 0
  - π_1 = F_81 (free group)
  - Aspherical

W(5, 3):
  - 364 points, many lines
  - H_1 = 0, H_2 = Z^{19683}
  - π_1 trivial or finite
  - NOT aspherical
  - Has interesting π_2

The rank-2 and rank-3 cases are TOPOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT!
