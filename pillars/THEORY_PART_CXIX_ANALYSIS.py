  THE W33 ↔ ALBERT ALGEBRA CONNECTION:

  Pick any vertex v in W33:

    40 = 1 + 12 + 27
       = v + N(v) + N̄(v)

  The 27 non-neighbors N̄(v):
    - Form an 8-regular subgraph H27 with 108 edges
    - Each connects to exactly μ = 4 of the 12 neighbors
    - The stabilizer Stab(v) of order 1296 acts on them

  THE PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

  If W33 encodes particle physics:
    - The vertex v = the "observer" or "vacuum"
    - The 12 neighbors = gauge/interaction structure (Reye/D4)
    - The 27 non-neighbors = matter content (one E6 generation)

  The decomposition 27 → 16 + 10 + 1 under SO(10) is:
    - 16 = one generation of fermions
    - 10 = Higgs fields
    - 1 = right-handed neutrino (or singlet)

  So W33 naturally contains:
    - 3 generations worth of structure (via triality/192)
    - The complete particle content (via 27/Albert)
    - The gauge structure (via 12/Reye/D4)
