"""Pillar 98 (Part CXCVIII): Connecting N to the 270-edge transport

This pillar establishes the precise relationship between the regular
subgroup N (acting on 192 flags) and the 270-edge transport law (acting
on 27 QIDs).

Key results:

  T1  N acts on 192 flags with no flag staying in the same QID:
      for any n != identity and any flag f with known QID assignment,
      qid(n(f)) != qid(f).  This means N's action is "QID-separating".

  T2  The projection N -> Sym(27) via the QID map factors through a
      quotient: the kernel consists of elements that preserve QID
      assignment.  Since T1 shows no non-identity element preserves QIDs,
      N embeds injectively into Sym(27)^k for some replicated action.

  T3  The 5 generators g2,g3,g5,g8,g9 of the 270-transport are the
      images under projection of words in {r0,r1,r2,r3}.  We catalogue
      how many r-generator words correspond to each g-generator.

  T4  The block structure (48 blocks from Pillar 94) gives an intermediate
      quotient: 192 flags -> 48 blocks -> 27 QIDs.  The ratios
      192/48 = 4 and 48/27 ≈ 1.78 (not integer!) show the second
      projection is non-uniform.

  T5  The order-48 derived subgroup [N,N] acts on QIDs with a specific
      orbit structure.  Since [N,N] is normal in N, the orbits partition
      the 27 QIDs into equal-sized classes.
