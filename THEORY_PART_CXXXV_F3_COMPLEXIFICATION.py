THEORY PART CXXXV: THE F₃ → ℂ COMPLEXIFICATION
===============================================

We explore how the finite field F₃ complexifies to give the Witting configuration.

KEY INSIGHT: The cube root ω = e^{2πi/3} is the link between:
- F₃ = {0, 1, 2} (mod 3 arithmetic)
- ℂ via the multiplicative character χ: F₃* → ℂ*

This explains WHY the Witting polytope has cube root phases!

THEOREM: Sp₄(3) has a UNIQUE quantum realization in ℂ⁴
with inner products |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² ∈ {0, 1/3}.

This is the WITTING CONFIGURATION.

The isomorphism works as follows:
1. F₃ coordinates (a,b,c,d) determine a projective point
2. Symplectic orthogonality ω(x,y)=0 becomes complex orthogonality
3. The automorphism group W(E₆) acts on both

PROOF SKETCH:
- The graph Sp₄(3) = SRG(40,12,2,4) is unique
- The eigenvalue structure determines the Gram matrix
- The Gram matrix with {0, 1/3} off-diagonal determines states up to unitary
