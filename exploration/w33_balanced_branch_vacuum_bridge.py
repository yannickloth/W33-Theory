"""Balanced rank-2 selector for the active external bridge branch.

This module packages the strongest conservative v39-style bridge statement that
is already defensible from tracked local data and exact repo-native bridge
theorems.

Already exact:
  - the nonlinear bridge packet is A4-only with reduced local prefactor
        27 / (16 pi^2);
  - rank-1 external branches kill the packet;
  - rank-2 activation enters quartically through |det C|^2;
  - the selected-point q=3 package fixes
        (81, 6, 8; 52, 56) and (320, 2240, 12480).

What is added here is the exact variational selector behind the active 2x2
branch. If C has singular-value squares x,y >= 0, then

    tr(C^* C) = x + y,
    |det C|^2 = x y,
    4 |det C|^2 = tr(C^* C)^2 - (x - y)^2 <= tr(C^* C)^2,

with equality iff x = y. So for fixed branch radius, the quartic bridge packet
is uniquely maximized by the balanced rank-2 branch.

Equivalently, in the reduced branch action

    V(C) = -mu tr(C^* C) + u tr(C^* C)^2 - v A |det C|^2,

the shape dependence is exactly

    V = -mu r^2 + (u - A v / 4) r^4 + (A v / 4) (x - y)^2,

with r^2 = x + y. Hence for A,v > 0 any shape imbalance is penalized, and if
mu > 0 together with 4u > Av, the unique nonzero balanced stationary radius is

    r_*^2 = 2 mu / (4u - Av),
    V_*   = -mu^2 / (4u - Av).

The checked local V29 stiffness summary is included only as observation: it is
numerically close to isotropic at quadratic order, which is consistent with
this reduced selector picture. The actual global branch-counting / orientation
theorem on the CP2_9 / K3_16 refinement tower remains open.
