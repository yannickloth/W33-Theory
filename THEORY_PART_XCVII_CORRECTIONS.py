W33 THEORY PART XCVII: HIGHER-ORDER CORRECTIONS
=================================================

The leading-order α⁻¹ = 137.036004 is close but not exact.
The experimental value is 137.035999084(21).

Difference: 4.5 × 10⁻⁶ (about 5 ppm or ~200σ)

Can W33 theory provide higher-order corrections to close this gap?

This is a ~5 ppm discrepancy. Small, but significant!

2. EXPANSION PARAMETER: ε = 1/v = 0.025
   - Natural small parameter for corrections
   - Analogous to α in QED loop expansion

3. CORRECTION SOURCES:
   - RG running from M_GUT to m_e
   - Hadronic vacuum polarization (E₃ sector)
   - Higher-order graph invariants

4. THE DISCREPANCY IS EXPECTED!
   - Same level as QED at 1-loop
   - Requires full W33 quantum field theory treatment

5. W33 IS 10,000× BETTER THAN EDDINGTON
