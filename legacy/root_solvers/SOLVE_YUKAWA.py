# Or: Σm²/((Σm)²/n) = n·Σm²/(Σm)² = 3·292/484 = 876/484 = 219/121 ≠ 2

# I think the Koide Q = 2/3 in THEORY uses eigenvalue RATIOS, not absolute values.

# Find a SECOND spread disjoint from the first one would give generation pairing.
# The overlap between two spreads S1, S2: for each line l1 ∈ S1, l2 ∈ S2,
# count |l1 ∩ l2|. Since lines are size 4 and S1, S2 each partition v=40:
# total overlaps: Σ|l1∩l2| = 40 (since both cover all points).
# With 10 lines in each spread: average |l1∩l2| = 40/(10·10) = 0.4

# The generational overlap matrix M_{ij} = |S1[i] ∩ S2[j]| is a 10×10 matrix
# with all row sums = 4 (each S1 line has 4 pts) and column sums = 4.
# This is a 10×10 doubly stochastic (times 4) matrix → normalized = bistochastic.

# The number of entries: each line meets at most 1 point of another line
# (since two lines in GQ share ≤ 1 point).
# Actually, two lines in a GQ either: share 0 or 1 points.
# So M_{ij} ∈ {0, 1}: it's a 10×10 binary matrix with row/col sums = 4.

# This means M is the biadjacency matrix of a 4-regular bipartite graph on 10+10 vertices!
# Its SVD gives the CKM-like mixing matrix.

# For the CKM connection: the 10×10 overlap → reduced to 3×3 via generation assignment.
# 10 = q²+1 lines in a spread → 3 generations from grouping lines.

# The CKM structure: the 3×3 subblock of M (from generation grouping) has entries
# that are integers summing to mu per row/col.

# The KEY identity for CKM: the number of spread pairs measures mixing.
# Two lines from different spreads: they either meet in 0 or 1 points.
